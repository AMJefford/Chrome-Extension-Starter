Chrome Extension Beginner

I wanted to start learning javascript and a simple way to begin is to create a chrome extension. 
In this simple example, I taught myself how to create a manifest.json, html, and js file. 
The extension changes the text on the chrome extension popup from red to black. It is a very short 
extension teaching the beginnings of how javascript and html work together, along with the permissions
from a json file.
